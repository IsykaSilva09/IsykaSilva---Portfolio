# IsykaSilva---Portfolio
Data | GIS | R | Ecology

## About Me
I have a B.S. in Biology from Sam Houston State University. I'm passionate about environmental sciecne, ecology, and using data/GIS to support conservation decisions. My goal is to transition into a role in ecological research, conservation biology, or environmental data science. This portfolio displays my ongoing learning, mini-projects, and technical skills.
