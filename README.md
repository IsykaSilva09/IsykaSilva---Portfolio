##  About Me
I hold a **B.S. in Biology** from *Sam Houston State University* and am passionate about **environmental science, ecology, and using data and GIS tools to support conservation decisions**.  

My goal is to transition into a role in **ecological research, conservation biology, or environmental data science**. This portfolio highlights my ongoing learning, mini-projects, and technical skills as I build toward that career path.
